    <h3>Hello my dear student! This is the Triwizard Tournament page. Here you will be able to access all 
        the tasks you need to complete in order to win the Triwizard Cup. In this Tournament, a champion will be

        will have to go through a series of tasks which will be challenging. So if you want to add your name to
        the Goblet of Fire, then don't waste any time!
